```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Goal

I want to find which countries are the most similar to each other in terms of their life expectancy, population and GDP over the years


# Load packages

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dtwclust))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(factoextra))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggrepel))
```

We'll use `dtwclust` for hierarchical clustering using the `dtw_basic` as the distance measure. If you are not familiar with these methods, please read about [dynamic time warping](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jcoleman/old_SLP/Lecture_5/DTW_explanation.html) and [hierachical clustering](https://people.revoledu.com/kardi/tutorial/Clustering/Numerical%20Example.htm).  


# Data

We are going to use the `gapminder` dataset for comparing different countries. Let's see the first few rows here:

```{r}
gapminder
```


Plot of life expectancy:

```{r}
# Let's plot the life expectancy over years 
# and represent each country by a line
ggplot(data=gapminder)+
  geom_line(aes(group=country, x=year, y=lifeExp,
                color = continent)) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent)
```

Similarly, you can plot other variables to see their time-series.  


# Cluster Analysis:

## Step 1) Choose the variables you want to use in calculating the dtw dissimilarity score

Here, I am choosing to use only the countries in Asia, and I am going to use life expectancy, population and GDP for the estimation of dtw score.

Also, it is important to scale all variables as right now they are in different scales. You can also scale them in the function that does the clustering.

```{r}
### Function to scale a variable
scale_this <- function(x){
  (x - mean(x, na.rm=TRUE)) / sd(x, na.rm=TRUE)
}


df <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% # countries in Asia only
  group_by(country) %>%           # scaling the vars for each country
  mutate(lifeExp = scale_this(lifeExp),
         pop = scale_this(pop),
         gdpPercap = scale_this(gdpPercap)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

df
```



## Step 2) Split the data by each country and convert to a matrix

This is required by the `dtwclust` package. 

```{r}
df_matrix <- df %>% 
  split(.$country, drop = T) %>% 
  purrr::map(~ .x[, c("lifeExp",    # names of all vars
                       "pop",
                       "gdpPercap"
                      )]) %>% 
  purrr::map(as.matrix) 

### printing out df shows the matrices by country
str(df_matrix[[1]])
```


## Step 3) Use the `tsclust` function from the `dtwclust` package for clustering using the dtw score

Both steps are done using a single function:

```{r}
clusters_gp <- df_matrix %>% 
  tsclust(., 
          k = 8L,                 # assuming clusters
          distance = "dtw_basic", # this is dtw score
          seed = 390,             # to reproduce results
          type="hierarchical",    # type of clustering
          control = hierarchical_control(method = "ward.D")) # method in hc

clusters_gp
```



# Plotting the results

## A dendrogram (tree)

```{r}
fviz_dend(clusters_gp, k = 8, # Cut the tree in groups
          cex = 0.5, # label size
          color_labels_by_k = TRUE, # color labels by groups
          rect = TRUE, # Add rectangle around groups
          horiz = TRUE, # Make the tree horizontal
          ylab = "DTW score",
          palette = "uchicago")
```


## Labeling countries based on clusters and visualizing each variable

We are now joining the estimated groups with the data:

```{r}
Gps <- as.data.frame(cutree(clusters_gp, k = 8)) # num of clusters
colnames(Gps) <- "Gp"
Gps$country <- row.names(Gps)
row.names(Gps) <- NULL



## Getting the clustering info into the original data
gapminder_Asia <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% 
  left_join(x=., y=Gps, by = "country")

gapminder_Asia
```


## Plotting each variable by group

Following plots show the time-series of life expectancy, population and GDP by group:  


```{r}
### Select 15 countries at random to label on plot
set.seed(123)

selected_countries <- gapminder_Asia %>% 
  group_by(Gp) %>% 
  select(country) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  sample_n(size = 4, replace = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  pull(country) %>% 
  unique()


sc_data <- gapminder_Asia %>% 
  filter(year == 1982,
         country %in% selected_countries)



### lifeExp
ggplot(data = gapminder_Asia,
       aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +

  geom_line(data = gapminder_Asia %>% 
              filter(country %in% selected_countries),
            aes(group=country)) +
  geom_text_repel(data = sc_data,
            aes(label = country),
            box.padding = 1,
            nudge_x = .15,
            nudge_y = .5,
            arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.015, "npc")),
            hjust = 0
            ) +
  theme_bw()

ggplot(data = gapminder_Asia,
       aes(x = year, y = pop)) +
  geom_line(aes(group=country), color = "grey") +
  facet_wrap(~ Gp, scales = "free_y") +
  geom_line(data = gapminder_Asia %>% 
              filter(country %in% selected_countries),
            aes(group=country)) +
  geom_text_repel(data = sc_data,
                  aes(label = country),
                  box.padding = 1,
                  nudge_x = .15,
                  nudge_y = .5,
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.015, "npc")),
                  hjust = 0
  ) +
  theme_bw()





### gdpPercap
pp <- ggplot(data = gapminder_Asia,
       aes(x = year, y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_line(aes(group=country), color = "grey") +
  facet_wrap(~ Gp, scales = "free_y") +
  geom_line(data = gapminder_Asia %>% 
              filter(country %in% selected_countries),
            aes(group=country)) +
  geom_text_repel(data = sc_data,
                  aes(label = country),
                  box.padding = 1,
                  nudge_x = .15,
                  nudge_y = .5,
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.015, "npc")),
                  hjust = 0
  ) +
  theme_bw()
